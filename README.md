# BigNumberCalculator 

## Hi!

This is my third project written in Java. The BigNumberCalculator is an advanced version of the classic calculator that can operate on large numbers in 3 different number systems. This app is really helpful when you need do some calculations in binary system or when you need to multiply more than 10-digit numbers! Below I advertise **instruction for users**, **the documentation for programmers** and **application extension prospects**!

## Instruction for users

BigNumberCalculator is really simple application.

You can do some basic operations like add, multiply, divide etc. BigNumberCalculator also allows you to calculate binomial coefficient, modulo, power and factorial. All of these oparations are avaiable in binary, decimal and hexadecimal numeral system. You can insert numbers directly from application (clicking particular button) or from your keybord! On the screen you can see your current edited number, last answer, operator and current numeral system.

If you have any questions, contact me!

## Documantation for programers

**Technologies:**
- Java
- JavaFX
- Maven
- CSS

Short info about some more important classes:
- ***CalculatorModel*** / ***CalculatorView*** / ***MainPaneController*** MVC role
- ***SafeOperation*** is responsible for doing safe oparations on numbers (e.g. not dividing by zero).

Implemeted software designed patterns:
- MVC

## Application extension prospects

Application is finished and ready to use, but there is some stuff that can upgrade BigNumberCalculator to be more advanced! Below i advertise some of ideas that I want to implement in future:

1. New idea of choosing numeral system
That would be really nice when user could select any numeral system that he wants! Of course application allows you to easly add new system!

2. Add some more advanced operations
I think operations on matrix would be really helpful.
